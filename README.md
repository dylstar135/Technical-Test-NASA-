Title - Nasa Image Search

For this technical test, i was asked to build an app that would retrieve and render images from the nasa api based on the search input of the user.

Built with - React

Testing Utilities - Jest, React Testing Library

Onced you have cloned the repo, simply type your search parameters into the search box (located centre middle) and hover over the images returned to see an enlarged version of them. To return to the apps original stae, simply click on the Nasa Logo

Given more time I plan to add in descriptions of each image as they are hovered over, a random buttin that will render random images when clicked, and the abi.ity to down load images
